TLS Drama
=========


Build it
--------

    docker build -t tls_drama .

Run it
------

    docker run -p 2103:2103 tls_drama

Test it
-------

Find your docker IP, localhost for linux user, $DOCKER_HOST for boot2docker user.

    python3 connect.py 192.168.59.103

Different version of python

 * Python 2.7.6 + OpenSSL 0.9.8 : *KO*
 * Python 2.7.8 + OpenSSL 1.0.1j : *KO*
 * Python 2.7 HEAD + OpenSSL 1.0.1j: *OK*
 * Python 3.4.2 + OpenSSL 1.0.1j: *OK*


You can try with your openssl too :

    openssl s_client -connect 192.168.59.103:2103 -tls1

Old opennssl will crash without explicit -tls1 option, new one handle it well

Lets try with Ruby.

Ugly certificate
----------------

The same certificate is used for client and server side, and I gave you a private key.
NOBODY SHOULD DO THAT.

But it's just a POC and life is short.
